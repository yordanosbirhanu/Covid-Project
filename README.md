# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis and visualization project that explores global COVID-19 trends, focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across selected countries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global COVID-19 data with a focus on specific countries (e.g., Kenya, India, United States).
- Visualize total cases and deaths over time.
- Compare vaccination rates and daily new cases.
- Calculate and interpret death rates to understand the severity of the pandemic.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** – static visualizations  
- **Seaborn** – advanced plotting  
- **Plotly Express** – interactive visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for code development and exploration

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2. Navigate to the folder:
cd your-repo-name

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

4. Make sure the dataset is present:
Place owid-covid-data.csv inside the same directory or update the file path in the code.

📊 Key Insights
The United States had the highest total number of cases and deaths.

India saw a steep surge in cases in mid-2021 but caught up in vaccinations.

Kenya’s vaccination rollout was slower but showed improvement by late 2022.

The death rate (total_deaths / total_cases) varied significantly across countries,
indicating differences in healthcare capacity and response.

💡 Reflections
This project provided hands-on experience in handling real-world datasets, 
cleaning messy data, and using Python libraries to extract meaningful insights. 
It demonstrated how data science can contribute to understanding global health issues and inform policy decisions.
